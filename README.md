# Edmonds-Karp
The Edmonds-Karp algorithm is explained and its complexity analysed in this report. We look at how the algorithm was
arrived at by detailing flow networks, the maximal flow problem, augmenting paths, residual graphs and the Ford-Fulkerson
method on which it is based. The time complexity is looked at in detail. We then move onto looking at limitations and
improvements for this algorithm, before seeing how it can be applied to real world problems.
